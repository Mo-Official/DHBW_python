# DHBW_python (Still thinking of a name)

This is a project required for my python course.

## Project Description:
This will be a Sci-fi Spaceshooter/Platformer game developed in pygame, but more effort will be put into the Platformer part.

# Endless mode
The Player can choose to play either the Spaceshooter or the Platformer with endless scrolling maps

# Story mode
I would like to add a demo level for the story, with some dialogs.
But Endless mode has to higher priority because I have to get the functionality of the game done first.

# Assets:
I will be using following assets for the project.

Player: https://opengameart.org/content/xeon-ultimate-smash-friends

Mobs: https://opengameart.org/content/open-gunner-expansion-pack-1

World: https://opengameart.org/content/2d-sci-fi-platformer-tileset-16x16


I haven't looked into sound effects or the Spaceshooter assets yet.
