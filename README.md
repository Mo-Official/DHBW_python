## Project Description:
This shall be a Sci-fi Spaceshooter/Platformer game developed in pygame, but more effort will be put into the Platformer part.
(The Spaceshooter has not been implemented)

### Endless mode
The Player can choose to play either the Spaceshooter or the Platformer with endless scrolling maps.
(This mode has not been implemented and will not be due to technical limitations.)

### Story mode
I would like to add a demo level for the story, with some dialogs.
(This mode has not been implemented fully, because of missing content)
