# story mode
the game should have a story mode with pre designed levels and a story connecting this levels.
at some parts there should be dialogs and scences.

# survival mode
maps are generated randomly and the player has to survive and collect points.
levels should get harder with played time.


# Required Concepts:

## main menu
set setting, select mode, load save file and exit game

## save files
start the last level played and continue the story

## Collision Detection
player shouldn't fall through normal platforms.
player should get hurt if they collide with enemies
player should kill an enemy if the collide with their weak point

## Player movement (realistic sideways movement)
Side ways and dashing

## Jump mechanics
normal jump and double jump

## Gravity and Friction
Gravity can change depending on the level parameters
friction can change depending on the platform parameter

## Warpable screen movement
idk what that is

## Scrolling the screen (creating an infinite height)
Vertical and horizontal scrolling

## Creating a Score counter
Player can collect coins and buy upgrades or unlock special dialogs between levels

## “Game Over” Mechanic
When health reaches zero player dies and has to restart later


# Might get added later:

## Shop inbetween levels
to buy health points, health potions or unlock dialogs

## checkpoint system
so the player doesn't have to start from the beginning of the level

## shooting mechanism
player can shoot enemies with ammo

## Random Platform movement
Not very important

## Random Level Generation
No very important, as the story mode is the main focus
